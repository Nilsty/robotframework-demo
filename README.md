# Demo test suite for Robotframework
This project will demo the use of the testing framework [Robotframework](https://robotframework.org/). In particular the [Selenium Library](https://pypi.org/project/robotframework-seleniumlibrary/) is used for UI testing as well as the [Requests Library](https://pypi.org/project/robotframework-requests/) is used for API testing.

## Run test suite in docker
`docker-compose up`

## Run test suite locally
To run the test suite locally the following needs to be installed:
- Google Chrome
- Chrome Driver
- Python 3
- pip libraries:
  - robotframework
  - robotframework-seleniumlibrary
  - selenium
  - robotframework-requests

More details can be found in the [Dockerfile](../master/Dockerfile)

After installing all requirements the test suite can be executed with:
`robot --outputdir=./output-local --variable HEADLESS_BROWSER_ENABLED:False robot-tests`

## Test report
After the tests have been run the test report can be accessed from the output folder. e.g. output/report.html

## Keyword documentation
When running the test suite in docker a keyword documentation file will be generated by the command `python -m robot.testdoc robot-tests output/keywords.html`
This keyword documentation can be used to inform other team members on what keywords have been defined and in which tests they are used.
